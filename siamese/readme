### Siamese Neural Network
---

These were experimets i have done in the time while i am waiting for recommendation letter from my professors 

#### Dataset
I am going to conduct my experiments from kaggle dataset - [http://https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database](http://https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)
The dataset consists of chest X-ray images of covid-19 positive cases along with normal and Viral Pneumonia images.

covid-19 positive images - 219
normal images                 - 1341
viral pneuomonia images - 1345

*Their is clearly class imbalance problem here. Instead to spend a lot of time before tackle this problem i have tried to build a model with imbalanced data to see how it goes and the results were promising.*
